# API-Tool
Able to see all the interactions and data between an API/Cookie and a website. Good for debugging and or whatever thing you're doing that needs API and cookie info like making prodigy or blooket hacks.

# How it stays undetected
Just cause the code is obfuscated does not mean its completely undetectable however these are the measures I put in place to make it mostly undetectable:

1. It stops console errors and warnings to make sure it stays undetected. 
2. It's heavily obfuscated with deadcode, weird prefix identifiers, strings, arrays, lots of functions and mangeled identifyers.
3. It carefully logs API and cookie data without changing bearer codes API keys etc so the network can keep working thus giving you more and more info.
4. Takes the normal window.fetch stores it and replaces it with a custom aysnc function.
